# Vita
My name is Gregor Trefs and I remember writing my first program when I was 12 years old. I attended a high school specialized in computer science where I implemented sophisticated elevator logic and soldered circuit boards.

I graduated in business informatics specializing in semantic web and data science. My thesis was about ranking [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query results. 

My first job was at a consulting company as an interface between our migration team and the customer departments affected by our changes. I learned that being on good terms with other teams is a big success factor. I missed developing software and decided to join a much smaller company as Research and Development Engineer.

The company develops a cloud management software using semantic technologies to integrate information about network equipment. I added a feature to patch whole landscapes of virtual machines at once and simplified the data access layer of the platform. Further, I managed the infrastructure for a research project. 

In February 2015, I got the opportunity to become a research assistant at my Alma mater as part of a third-party project seeking for opportunities how to apply analytic algorithms in order to improve customer experience in a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) software. I spent two months in Singapore at the headquarter of the third-party contractor. It was a very exciting experience. Eventually, the project did not work out and the contract was canceled. By then, we decided to build a new platform for semantically integrating processes. With the help of three students we published our first release by the end of 2015. Until now, multiple releases are available on [github](https://github.com/InES-Mannheim). 

# Values
I value learning and team work. For me it is important to have environment where sharing knowledge and discussions are appreciated and supported.

# Skills
I am very proficient in Java. I am currently interested in the functional extensions of Java 8. Together with [Artem](https://twitter.com/_akozlov) I gave an introduction to functional programming in Java 8 at the [majug](http://www.majug.de). I will give a talk about this topic at [JavaLand 2017](https://www.javaland.eu).

Since almost two years, I am also looking into Scala. Although, I have no real work experience here, I wrote some prototypes and I am currently learning how to do [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). 

I also wrote some scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python and Ruby. With Ruby I have some work experience as intern in a startup company. I also wrote some JavaScript in Node and did some CSS. My favorite build tool is Gradle, but I also have experience with Maven and SBT. 

I am a certified Scrum Master and eagerly try to understand all the facets of [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). I have some pair-programming experience and write my code in a test-driven manner. Please also have a look on my [github account](https://github.com/gtrefs).

# Vita
My name is Gregor Trefs and I remember writing my first program when I was 12 years old. A friend and I created a little text adventure in BASIC. The same friend introduced me to Flash and ActionScript. I defenitly was on the dark side using all kinds of filters and animation techniques. I attended a high school specialized in computer science where I implemented sophisticated elevator logic and soldered circuit boards. I graduated in business informatics specializing in semantic web and data science. My thesis was about ranking [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query results. My first job was at a consulting company. I was an interface between my migration team and the customer departments affected by our changes. I learned a lot about project management, but missed developing software. Therefore, I joined a much smaller company as Research and Development Engineer. The company develops a cloud management software using semantic technologies to integrate information about network equipment. Together with another developer I added a feature to patch whole landscapes of virtual machines at once. Further, I simplified the data access layer of the platform by developing a mapping between objects and data. Last, I managed the infrastructure for a research project. In February 2015, I got the opportunity to become a research assistent at my alma mater as part of a third-party project seeking for opportunities how to apply analytic algorithms in order to improve customer experience in a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) software. I spent two months in Singapore at the headquarter of the third-party contractor. It was a very exciting experience. Eventually, the project did not work out and the contract was cancelled. By then, we decided to build a new platform for semantically integrating processes. With the help of three students we published our first release by the end of 2015. Until now, multiple releases are available on [github](https://github.com/InES-Mannheim). 

# Values
I appriciate learning, modesty, team work and interest. Software developers need time and education to become familiar with a topic. It is important to acknowldge and support this. Not caring about learning is one of the factors to become an [expert beginner](http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). Software development is about communication. I believe in [conways law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law). If the team is not working right, whatever the reason is, it will be reflected in the outcome. Developers should be self-reflective and interested. Ask yourself what your interests are, order them by importance and start learning. People have different opinions. A modest behaviour facilitates discussing these opinions and, thus, gathering insights.

# Skills
I am very proficient in Java. I am currently interested in the functional extensions of Java 8. Together with [Artem](https://twitter.com/_akozlov) I gave an introduction to functional programming in Java 8 at the [majug](http://www.majug.de). I will give a talk about this topic at [JavaLand 2017](https://www.javaland.eu). Since almost two years, I am also looking into Scala. Although, I have no real work experience here, I wrote some prototypes and I am currently learning how to do [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). I also wrote some scripts in Bash, PowerShell, Python and Ruby. With Ruby I have some work experience as intern in a startup company. I also wrote some JavaScript in Node and did some CSS. My favorite build tool is Gradle, but I also have experience with Maven and SBT. I am a certified Scrum Master and eagerly try to understand all the facest of [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). I have some pair-programming experience and write my code in a test-driven manner. Please also have a look on my [github account](https://github.com/gtrefs). 

# Hire me
I am very interested in working with a company which honors software craftsmanhip. If you do Scala, I am even more interested. I offer schooling in Java 8, RDF and/or GIT. If you think, I fit in your company, please write me a mail:

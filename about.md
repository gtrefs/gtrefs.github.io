# Gregor 
My full name is Gregor David Trefs and I work in the field of software development.
I have a masters degree in business informatics specializing in semantic web and data science.
In my thesis, I tried to find a good way to rank [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query results.

Since then, I had various jobs in IT.
For example, I helped migrating software from one data center to another. 
I build a cloud management software in a small company as Research and Development Engineer.
In 2015, I started and stopped graduating.
Within this time I enabled a company to access its semantic data in an analytical way and created a platform for semantically integrating processes: [github](https://github.com/InES-Mannheim).
From 2017 to 2018, I was a full time freelancer and then joined a company as Team Leader. 

With 4 others, I organize the local [Java User Group](https://www.majug.de) and founded the local software crafters community.

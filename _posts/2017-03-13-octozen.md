Last year at Socrates [Matthias](https://github.com/mwiesen) gave a little introduction how GitHub makes GitHub. A little collection of 14 statements, called zen, capture the core values and principles. This zen is available through the public API.

Let's have a look on such a zen statement. Try it out:

```Bash
curl https://api.github.com/octocat
```

You get back a octocat telling you one zen statement.

```
               MMM.           .MMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM      _____________________
              MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM    |                     |
             MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   | Speak like a human. |
            MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   |_   _________________|
            MMMM::- -:::::::- -::MMMM    |/
             MM~:~ 00~:::::~ 00~:~MM
        .. MMMMM::.00:::+:::.00::MMMMM ..
              .MM::::: ._. :::::MM.
                 MMMM;:::::;MMMM
          -MM        MMMMMMM
          ^  M+     MMMMMMMMM
              MMMMMMM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                .~~MM~MM~MM~MM~~.
             ~~~~MM:~MM~~~MM~:MM~~~~
            ~~~~~~==~==~~~==~==~~~~~~
             ~~~~~~==~==~==~==~~~~~~
                 :~==~==~==~==~~

```

I really like this and created a little [zsh plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/5959) which displays a zen statement, every time you start a console. When I am lucky [Robby Russel](https://github.com/robbyrussell) will accept my pull request.

If you are unwilling to wait, then you can just add the following code to your `.zshrc`. This might even work with `bash` but I did not test it.

```Bash
function display_octozen() {
  local command="curl -s https://api.github.com/octocat"
  local zen=$(eval ${command})
  if [ "$zen" != "" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' ${zen}
  fi
}
 
display_octozen
``` 

Until then, happy coding.
